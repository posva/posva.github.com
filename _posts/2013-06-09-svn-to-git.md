## svn... WHY?!
Sometimes you find svn repositories, yes it happens... Other times you even created them because you were not aware of the existance of git _(blame on me)_. The point is we need to get in into a git repository!

## Then how do we do it
Searching a bit on google you find some utilities like `subgit` or `svn2git` (which uses `git svn`). There is also some method that need to use svnadmin but we'll try to avoid them...

The simpliest way is to use [svn2git](https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git) along with an authors.txt file.

 * First you need to check the authors of commit in the svn repo:
 {% highlight bash %}
 svn log --quiet | grep "^r" | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq
 {% endhighlight %}
 If there are any names with spaces you will need to find them :P
* Create and authors.txt file and add every name you found:
 {% highlight bash %}
 name = Git Name <email@mai.com>
 {% endhighlight %}
* Then depending on the tree of your svn repo you need to run different commands that can be found in the [Readme](https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git#readme). If the repo is configured as default with trunk, wiki, doc, etc you just need to do:
 {% highlight bash %}
 cd git-repo # Go to the directory you want to create the git repo
 svn2git --authors ~/authors.txt http://path-to-repo/svn/ -v
 {% endhighlight %}
 Adding the verbose option (`-v`) is optional but very recommended to find errors faster if the process fail. Wait, and enjoy your new git repo!
 Just one Last thing, remember to supress the _trunk_ at the end from your url if you hae the default layout.
 For local svn repositories do the same as above but use `file://<absolute-path-to-repo>` instead of the url

 Hope it helps!
