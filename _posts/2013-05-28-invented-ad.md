Hey, today I have something that have nothing to deal with my projects. It's just a work we needed to do for a disciple. I have some fun using my tablet and drew on top of some bioshock drawings to get something not too ugly.

There were many ads and people voted, I turned out that my poster won :P

I just wanted to show it off:

It's in French because I'm studying in France, not a big deal...
