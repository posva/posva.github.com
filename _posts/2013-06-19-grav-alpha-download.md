As I said, here it is, an alpha release, still buggy, but doesn't matter :P. However there are some things you should know: -You can only use letters, numbers and dots for password and username -Giving the background a huge opacity may be dangerous... Seriously... Now you're ready to go! DOWNLOAD IT!

Update: I found a bug, and I need you to take care for the moment: When you launch the game the first time and you create an account you have to close the game and relaunch it to be able to send scores. I'm sorry about that I will fix it soon.
