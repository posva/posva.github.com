##A bit of History

Kill da Ducks is a 2D fast paced shoot'em up.
 I started it back in 2008 but I wrote it in GML for [Game Maker](http://www.yoyogames.com).
 It was quite neat but was far from being ended.
 At that point I started the university and couldn't work on it as much as I wanted.
 I also started to use _better_ languages like C and C++ and therefore felt the _need_ of using these language for better perfs and _amazing_ gameplays.
 
 The point is that I started all over again... multiple times...
  And having less and less times while going further in my studies I keep trying to work on this game.
