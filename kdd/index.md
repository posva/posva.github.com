##A bit of History

Kill da Ducks is a 2D fast paced shoot'em up.
 I started it back in 2008 but I wrote it in GML for [Game Maker](http://www.yoyogames.com).
 It was quite neat but was far from being ended.
 At that point I started the university and couldn't work on it as much as I wanted.
 I also started to use _better_ languages like C and C++ and therefore felt the _need_ of using these language for better perfs and _amazing_ gameplays.
 
 The point is that I started all over again... multiple times...
 And having less and less times while going further in my studies I keep trying to work on this game.

Here is what it looked like when it was developped with Game Maker:

It was funny to play ^^

##Demos

* (**2010**) The GM Demo is avaible [here](http://db.tt/Zxos39W).
 It auto updates at launch to the last version

 --------------

##Design
The game idea is based around some kind of duck invasion or something.
 The story itself may change but you will get **blood** and **ducks** everywhere.

It may remind you to Metal Slug sometimes.
 The chapters Bosses will be fun to do and not just shoot as much as you can.
 Thanks to the Lua binding we're developping, custom stories could be created quite easily with some programming and custom resources loading with `xml` files.
