# About Me

I'm a Javascript enthusiast who focus on UI and who likes game dev too. I am a member of the Vue.js core team and I organize the Paris Vue.js Meetup. I help daily to improve the Vue ecosystem.

Do you need help building large scale applications with Vue? Or maybe do you want a personalized course for a group of people. In that case feel free to contact me for more information at _posva_ at _icloud.com_.
